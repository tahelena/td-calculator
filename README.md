# Term Deposit Calculator
Code exercise - Build a simple Term Deposit Calculator

## To run the project:

### `npm start`
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm test`
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

## A few notes:
I only wrote a few tests for the calculator function, not for the component.\
I have tried to give feedback and warnings on the UI.

Thanks :)
